# Kubernetes MicroProfile Lab
This lab illustrates steps to deploy a MicroProfile application in a Kubernetes environment.  You can choose the following flavours of Kubernetes for the lab:

*  [Instructions for Minikube](https://github.com/microservices-api/kubernetes-microprofile-lab/tree/master/lab-instructions/minikube): light weight single-node k8, recommended to run in a developer's laptop.
*  [Instructions for IBM Cloud Private](https://github.com/microservices-api/kubernetes-microprofile-lab/tree/master/lab-instructions/ibm-cloud-private): enterprise-grade k8 with multiple nodes, recommended to run in different VMs.

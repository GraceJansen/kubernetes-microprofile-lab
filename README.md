![Think 2018 Logo](think_logo.png)

This lab illustrates steps to deploy a MicroProfile application, running in a WebSphere Liberty docker container, into a Kubernetes environment, such as IBM Cloud Private.  You can choose the following flavours of Kubernetes for the lab:

*  [Instructions for Minikube](https://microservices-api.github.io/kubernetes-microprofile-lab/lab-instructions/minikube): light weight single-node k8, recommended to run in a developer's laptop.
*  [Instructions for IBM Cloud Private](https://microservices-api.github.io/kubernetes-microprofile-lab/lab-instructions/ibm-cloud-private): enterprise-grade k8 with multiple nodes, recommended to run in different VMs.

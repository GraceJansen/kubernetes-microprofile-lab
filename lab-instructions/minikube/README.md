# Deploying a MicroProfile application in a minikube cluster

This is the simplest way for a developer to get the sample up and running locally.

## Before you begin

* Install a Git client to obtain the sample code.
* Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and a Java 8 JDK.
* Install a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) engine.

## Install minikube and fabric artifacts

1. Install minikube and the Microservice Builder fabric as described in [Running Kubernetes in your development environment](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5PWC/setup.html#running-kubernetes-in-your-development-environment).
1. Enable ingress with the command `minikube addons enable ingress`

## Build application and container

1. Clone the project into your machine by running `git clone https://github.com/microservices-api/kubernetes-microprofile-lab.git`
1. Build the sample microservice by running `cd kubernetes-microprofile-lab/lab-artifacts` and then  `mvn clean package`
1. Set the Docker CLI to target the minikube Docker engine by running `eval $(minikube docker-env)`
1. Build the docker image by running `docker build -t microservice-vote .`

## Deploy WebSphere Liberty and Cloudant helm chart 

1. Deploy the microservice with the following helm install command `helm install --name=vote helm-chart/microservice-vote`
1. You can view the status of your deployment by running `kubectl get deployments`.  You want to wait until both `microservice-vote-deployment` and `vote-ibm-cloudant-dev` deployments are available.
1. Use `kubectl get ing | awk 'FNR == 2 {print $3;}'` to determine the address of the application.  Prepend `https` and append `/openapi/ui` to that URL and open this location in a web browser to access the application. For example, `https://192.168.99.100/openapi/ui` 
1. Congratulations, you have successfully deployed a [MicroProfile](http://microprofile.io/) container into a kubernetes cluster!  The deployment also included a Cloudant container that is used by our microservice, and an ingress layer to provide connectivity into the API. 

## Explore the application
The `vote` application is using various MicroProfile specifications.  The `/openapi` endpoint of the application exposes the [MicroProfile OpenAPI](http://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.0.1/microprofile-openapi-spec.html) specification.  The `/openapi/ui` endpoint is a value-add from [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/), which WebSphere Liberty is based upon.  This UI allows developers and API consumers to invoke the API right from the browser!

1. Expand the `POST /attendee` endpoint and click the `Try it out` button.
